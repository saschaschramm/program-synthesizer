# Program Synthesizer

## Introduction
This is a language model based program synthesizer that can synthesize programs from a given program specification.

</div>

A language model based code synthesizer `(3)` is used to synthesize a program iteratively. A specification `(1)` describes the change between the old `(2)` and new program `(4)`. The language model uses the specification and old program to generate the new program. After each step the program is executed by a verifier `(5)`. The verifier checks the program for errors and if there are errors the feedback is used by the language model to generate a new program without errors.

## Example specifications

### "Hello, World!" specification
The folder `specs` contains the file `program-hello.spec` that specifies a simple "Hello, World!" program.

Old program:
```Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
```

Prompt:
```Python
### Old
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
### Specification
Change the old program according to the following specification:
Add a function hello that returns the string "hello, world"
### New
```

New program:
```Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass

def hello():
    return "hello, world"
```

### OpenID connect specification
The folder `specs` contains the file `program-oidc.spec` that specifies a simple OpenID connect client program. The specification for the client is based on the official [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html) specification.

## Run program synthesis
For running the program synthesizer access to the OpenAI Codex model is required:
```
python main.py
```

## Sandbox

Run sandbox
```bash
sh sandbox.sh
```

## Results
| Test | Pass@1 | Num Pass | Date
| --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| 1 | 54.88% | 90 | 2022-09-23 |
| 2 | 59.15% | 97 | 2022-09-28 |
| 3 | 56.10% | 92 | 2022-09-28 |

* Test 1: The program generated by the synthesizer is evaluated  
* Test 2: The program generated by the synthesizer and fixed by the auto debugger is evaluated. The auto debugger prompt contains the interpreter exception.  
* Test 3: The program generated by the synthesizer and fixed by the auto debugger is evaluated. The auto debugger prompt doesn't contain the interpreter exception.
